    \label{sec:done}



    \subsection{Scientific publications}
    \label{sec:done:publications}
    %
    During the first year of my Ph.D., I have done several activities including scientific publications, developing research technologies, and teaching.
    %
    Concerning my scientific articles, this is the list of the papers I have published so far:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ``On the Design of PSyKI: a Platform for Symbolic Knowledge Injection into Sub-Symbolic Predictors''~\cite{psyki-extraamas2022}
        \item ``KINS: Knowledge Injection via Network Structuring''~\cite{kins-cilc2022}
        \item ``A view to a KILL: Knowledge Injection via Lambda Layer''~\cite{kill-woa2022}
        \item ``Bridging Symbolic and Sub-Symbolic AI: Towards Cooperative Transfer Learning in Multi-Agent Systems''~\cite{ctl-aixia2022}
        \item ``Symbolic Knowledge Extraction for Explainable Nutritional Recommenders''~\cite{skerecommender-cmbp235}
        \item ``Knowledge injection of Datalog rules via Neural Network Structuring with KINS''~\cite{kins-jlc2023}
        \item ``Symbolic Knowledge Injection meets Intelligent Agents: QoS metrics and experiments''~\cite{skiqos-jaamas37}
        \item ``A General-Purpose Protocol for Multi-Agent based Explanations''~\cite{explanationprotocol-extraamas2023}
    \end{itemize}
    %
    Already accepted papers waiting for publication:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ``Symbolic Knowledge Extraction and Injection with Sub-symbolic Predictors: a Systematic Literature Review'', ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR).
    \end{itemize}
    %
    I have also submitted / will submit the following papers:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ``LLM-based Solutions for Healthcare Chatbots: a Comparative Analysis'', submitted at the 3rd International Workshop on Telemedicine and E-Health Evolution in the New Era Of Social Distancing (TELMED 2024);
        \item ``Addressing Intersectional Fairness: a Practical Approach with FaUCI'', submitted at the 33rd International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2024);
        \item ``Analysing Fairness in Neural Networks under Constraint Injection with FaUCI'' submitted at the 33rd International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2024);
        \item ``Large language models as oracles for instantiating ontologies with domain-specific knowledge'' will be submitted soon probably at the Journal of Web Semantics or at the Knowledge-Based Systems journal.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Research technologies}
    \label{sec:done:technologies}
    %
    I have developed and I am currently maintaining the following research technologies:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{PSyKI}~\cite{psyki-extraamas2022}: a platform for symbolic knowledge injection into sub-symbolic predictors available at \url{https://github.com/psykei/psyki-python};
        \item \textbf{PSyKE}~\cite{psyke-woa2021}: a knowledge injection technique based on neural network structuring available at \url{https://github.com/psykei/psyke-python};
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Teaching}
    \label{sec:done:teaching}
    %
    I have been teaching the following courses:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item teaching assistant for the curse ``Distributed System'' (A.Y. 2023/2024) for the Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering (24 hours);
        \item teacher at professional education course (May 2023) for BPER Data Analytics, BBS (8 hours);
        \item teaching assistant for the curse ``Fondamenti di Informatica'' (A.Y. 2022/2023) for the Bachelor's Degree in Electronics Engineering and Biomedical Engineering (35 hours);
        \item teaching assistant for the curse ``Sistemi Distribuiti'' (A.Y. 2022/2023) for the Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering (24 hours);
    \end{itemize}


    \section{Plan for the remaining years}
    \label{sec:todo}
    %
    From March to June 2024, I will spend a period abroad at the University of Oslo under the supervision of Prof. Ana Ozaki.
    %
    During this period, I will work on neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence in the context of the \href{https://www.integreat.no/index.html}{Integreat} project.
    %
    More in detail, the project will make machine learning more sustainable, accurate, trustworthy, and ethical.
    %
    Integreat develops theories, methods, models and algorithms that integrate general and domain-specific knowledge with data.
